# Testing Strategy for United Airlines Web App - 2024
To this scope, the [Testing Strategy]() only will cover the [**"Flights from Chicago Page"**](), and the [test cases]() for the **"Search Fligths"** Section 

## Testing Strategy for the Flights from Chicago Page 
This document outlines the testing strategy for the "Flights from Chicago" âœˆ page of the United Airlines website/webapp. The goal is to asure Basic Correct Functionality, Optimal Performance, Accurate and Reliable Information, and Stringent Security Standards.

## Overview
The testing strategy covers various aspects including functional testing, performance testing, security testing, compatibility testing, usability testing, regression testing, localization, and internationalization testing, accessibility testing, and disaster recovery testing which are beoing considered Tests Categories for this testing Strategy. By other hand, _as stated in the excercize,_ The Search Functionality will be the subject of the functional testing cases.

## Test Categories
While developing the testing strategy this Variety of tests come along to cover the overall experience in this page:

1. **Test Planning**: Understand requirements, define objectives, identify techniques, and allocate resources.
2. **Functional Testing**: Covers search functionality, daily fares display, information panel, and popular deals table.
3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluates page load time, server response time, and system performance under peak loads.
4. **Security Testing**: Conducts vulnerability assessment, ensures secure communication, and checks authentication mechanisms.
5. **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures compatibility with different browsers and devices.
6. **Usability Testing**: Evaluates user experience, navigation, layout, and accessibility compliance.
7. **Regression Testing**: Executes tests after code changes to ensure existing functionality remains intact.
8. **Localization and Internationalization Testing**: Verifies language support, currency conversions, and date formats.
9. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensures compliance with accessibility guidelines for users with disabilities.
10. **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Simulates system failures and assesses recovery mechanisms.

## Conclusion
By following this comPrehensive testing strategy, I aim to guaRantee that the "Flights from ChicagO" page meets quality standards, enhances uSer experience, and ensures customer satisfaction.
