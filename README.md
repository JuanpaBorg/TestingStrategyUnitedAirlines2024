By other hand, _as stated in the exercise,_ The Search Functionality will be the subject of the functional testing cases.

## Test Categories
While developing the testing strategy this Variety of tests come along to cover the overall experience in this page:

1. **Test Planning**: Understand requirements, define objectives, identify techniques, and allocate resources.
2. **Functional Testing**: Covers search functionality, daily fares display, information panel, and popular deals table.
3. **Performance Testing**: Evaluates page load time, server response time, and system performance under peak loads.
4. **Security Testing**: Conducts vulnerability assessment, ensures secure communication, and checks authentication mechanisms.
5. **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures compatibility with different browsers and devices.
6. **Usability Testing**: Evaluates user experience, navigation, layout, and accessibility compliance.
7. **Regression Testing**: Executes tests after code changes to ensure existing functionality remains intact.
8. **Localization and Internationalization Testing**: Verifies language support, currency conversions, and date formats.
9. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensures compliance with accessibility guidelines for users with disabilities.
10. **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Simulates system failures and assesses recovery mechanisms.
